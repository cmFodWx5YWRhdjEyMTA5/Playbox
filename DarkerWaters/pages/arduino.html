	  <h1>Arduino</h1>
	  <p>This page is stil under construction but is intended to be about my work on Arduino.
	  I have bought some <a href="https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/using-the-arduino-pro-mini-33v">Pro Mini</a> versions to see if I can't automate our house blinds for a bit of fun.
	  And I am going to be sure to make them <a href="http://donalmorrissey.blogspot.co.uk/2010/04/putting-arduino-diecimila-to-sleep.html">Sleep as much as possible</a> so the batteries last
	  a long time.
