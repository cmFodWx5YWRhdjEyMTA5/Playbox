	  <h1>Arduino</h1>
	  <p>This page is stil under construction but is intended to be about my work on Arduino.
	  I have bought some <a href="https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/using-the-arduino-pro-mini-33v">Pro Mini</a> versions to see if I can't automate our house blinds for a bit of fun.
	  And I am going to be sure to make them <a href="http://donalmorrissey.blogspot.co.uk/2010/04/putting-arduino-diecimila-to-sleep.html">Sleep as much as possible</a> so the batteries last
	  a long time.

    <h2>Dot Matrix Disloy</h2>
    <p>All credit to the places I copied of the <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/16x8-LED-dot-matrix-with-MAX7219-module/">internet</a> but I started with a little dot-matrix display to show some messages in a scrolling device. <a href="./example_files/sketch_dotMatrix.ino">Here is the Sketch</a>.

    <br>This is using the <a href="https://code.google.com/p/arudino-maxmatrix-library/">MaxMatrix</a>Library.

    <h2>Arduino Pro Mino</h2>
    <p>I found and bought some nice <a href="https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/using-the-arduino-pro-mini-33v">Pro Mini 5v</a> boards to go smaller than standard and specific to function. Although it is important on the mac to install the correct <a href="https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/how-to-install-ftdi-drivers/mac">mac driver</a> and disable the included apple one. A very useful function to set the time is to use the RTCSet demo and <a href="http://www.unixtimestamp.com/">online timestamp</a> to set the time on the RTC chip, or if you want alarms, the updated <a href="https://github.com/JChristensen/DS3232RTC">3232 library</a> works. Nicely using the <a href="http://playground.arduino.cc/Code/Enerlib">Enerlib library</a> for sleeping the chip as explained <a href="http://donalmorrissey.blogspot.co.uk/2010/04/arduino-external-interrupts.html">here</a>.
