	  <p>This page is stil under construction but is intended to be about the web-techs I learn and play with. I found this <a href="https://www.udemy.com/complete-web-developer-course/">course</a> on
	  Udemy which proved to be interesting and useful to start with.
	  <br/><strong>GWT</strong> is something I am interested in learning and playing with so there is a whole <a href="#gwt">child page</a> on this one.
	  <br/><strong>AngularJS</strong> is something I will be looking at for work so here is a <a href="https://blog.openshift.com/day-2-angularjs-getting-my-head-around-angularjs/">tutorial</a> I have been looking at for that.
	  <br/>I found an <a href="http://jstherightway.org/">OK Article</a> on javascript OO which was a helpful place to start.
