	  <h1>Client-Web</h1>
	  <p>This page is stil under construction but is intended to be about the web-techs I learn and play with. I found this <a href="https://www.udemy.com/complete-web-developer-course/">course</a> on
	  Udemy which proved to be interesting and useful to start with.
	  <br/><strong>GWT</strong> is something I am interested in learning and playing with so there is a whole <a href="#gwt">child page</a> on this one.
	  <br/><strong>AngularJS</strong> is something I will be looking at for work so here is a <a href="https://blog.openshift.com/day-2-angularjs-getting-my-head-around-angularjs/">tutorial</a> I have been looking at for that.
	  <br/>I found an <a href="http://jstherightway.org/">OK Article</a> on javascript OO which was a helpful place to start.
	  <h2>Downloading files</h2>
	  <p>For my PicSync application I needed to do some file management, so decided to use the download facility of the browser to rename the dropped image files and put them somewhere organised for the user to then place in their images folder. This had a few problems as I wanted to download many files and the browsers kept asking permission. Which sucks. I did to a .zip file option using <a href="https://stuk.github.io/jszip/">jsZip</a> which worked OK but found that in Safari downloads suck too.
	  <ul>
	  	<li><strong>Downloading in Safari</strong> can use <a href="http://www.pixelgraphics.us/downloadify/test.html">Downloadify</a> but it isn't great to be honest.</li>
	  	<li><Strong><a href="https://github.com/eligrey/FileSaver.js">Filesaver</a></Strong> allows a browser to save a file as a download. Seems to work nicely.</li>
	  	<li><Strong><a href="http://webqr.com">Web QR</a></Strong> is a nice port of google's x-crossing for creating QR codes.</li>
	  	<li><Strong><a href="https://github.com/jseidelin/exif-js">Exif JS</a></Strong> is a nice library for reading EXIF data in javascript.</li>
	  </ul>
