	  <h1>What is Darker Waters LTD</h1>
	  <p>Well if you are looking for a business / service / project then you have most likely got the name / domain wrong (o; Darker Waters LTD (.co.uk) is
	  basically Douglas Brain. Douglas being Gaelic for Dark Waters... As I didn't know much about web-sites and technologies and wanted to learn I thought
	  I would create a site for my musings, learnings, informatings, and sellings of me...</p>
	  <p>One thing I am into at the moment to learn more and improve my skill set to a wider range of things is sign up to 
	  <a href="https://www.udemy.com/home/my-courses/#/learning">Udemy</a>. It is pretty cool and if you wait they seem to have a regular sale in which
	  things are Â£8. I am also trying to do <a href="http://yogawithadriene.com/30-days-of-yoga-01/">30 days of Yoga</a> to make myself nice and flexible as I get old.</p>
