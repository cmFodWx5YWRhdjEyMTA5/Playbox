	  <p>This site will be a bit messy and always under consruction as is a repository for things I need to remember and point other people to.
	  so hopefully it will be somewhat useful.
	  I did start out on <a href="https://wordpress.com/stats/darkerwaters.wordpress.com">Wordpress</a> but thought it might be fun and interesting to create a web-site from scratch with things in and on.

	  <strong>OpenCV</strong> has been interesting for <a href="http://docs.opencv.org/modules/highgui/doc/reading_and_writing_images_and_video.html">writing video</a> using cpp so can be embedded and building on the device. Also <a href="http://docs.opencv.org/doc/tutorials/highgui/video-write/video-write.html">creating tutorial</a> is pretty good.
