    <h1>Sublime</h1>
    <p>So with everyone telling me I should be using Sublime to create and edit web-content I thought I would at least try it... So I downloaded the evaluation version of version 3 and decided to commit to use it to create my website
    <ul>
    <li>I found a <a href="https://blog.generalassemb.ly/sublime-text-3-tips-tricks-shortcuts/">handy quick start guide for Sublime Plugins</a></li>
    <li>And how <a href="https://www.exratione.com/2014/01/setting-up-sublime-text-3-for-javascript-development/">to setup for JavaScript</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://livestyle.emmet.io/usage/">Live Style</a> seems OK if you are playing with CSS but what I want is a bit of WYSIWYG using Sublime</li>
    <li>I did install <a href="https://github.com/SublimeCodeIntel/SublimeCodeIntel">SublimeCodeIntel</a> to see if that is a help</li>
    <li>If I was OK paying I could buy <a href="http://fibiola.com/live-code-preview-sublime-text/">LiveReload</a> but am a little reluctant to pay for something so basic</li>
    </ul>
