<p>Hello, I am glad you are interested and have come across my site.
As you may be able to tell this is not a professional money-making web-site, just something I have created while ill myself.
Two years prior to creating this site, I was diagnosed with Chronic-Fatigue, in my efforts to stabilise my symptoms and get back
to a more active social and work life I looked a lot for something to track my mental state, and its effects on my fatigue.
I found very little, and since my day-job is the creation of software, I thought "why not create my own?". So here it is.
</p>
<h4>Goals</h4>
<p>I have no plans to put too much into the site as it makes me nothing and I intend to keep it that way. If, however, you experience any problems
or have a need for something new please use the "contact" page to let me know what you would like. You never know, I might just add it.</p>
<h4>Site Technology</h4>
<p><img src="images/gwt.jpeg"/>
The site itself is created using Google's <a href="http://www.gwtproject.org/">GWT</a> technology and 
the <a href="http://designmodo.github.io/Flat-UI/">FlatUI</a> styling library. This choice was made quite simply because I was interested in the technologies and it
was a good opportunity to investigate and practice them. I found GWT in particular to be very good at creating on-line applications and the combination with the 
FlatUI javascript and css taught me to interface with the wider world of open-source javascript resources. In the future, I think I will be using more GWT in combination
with various things I can find for free on the Internet to style it nicer.</p>
<p>As it is created predominantly with Google technologies, I suspect that it works best with Google's own <a href="https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/">Chrome</a> browser
but it does promise to work with them all and I have tested the application in everything I sensibly can.</p>

fitness trackers. I found the Shine to be a nice simple device that allows me to track activity, sleep, and deep sleep without constantly charging the thing.
