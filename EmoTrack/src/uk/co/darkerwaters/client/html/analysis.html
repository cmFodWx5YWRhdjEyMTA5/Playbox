<p> Unfortunately it isn't enough to simply track your emotions, activity, sleep, etc. You have to actually look back for patterns and correlations
in order to break the pattern of negative thoughts and behaviours. This is best performed alongside a qualified therapist. I cannot recommend enough
seeing a professional to help you get better. It accelerates and improves you chances of recovery substantially. Take the time and money to invest in
yourself, you cannot find a better thing to invest in. If cost is an issue, there are many organisations in place to help for reduced costs, or free. 
Talk to your GP and seek help, there is a lot out there, and it helps a lot. This site is created for the suffering, but also for you to show
your therapist, they will see things you do not, and help you challenge things you think fixed.

<p><img src="images/graphs.png" style="height: 32px"/>The "track" page shows graphs that all line up on the date logged so you
can see how events effect your mood, how a lack of sleep or activity effects your fatigue and so on. However, sometimes patterns, trends and correlations can
hide within the data and be difficult to see by looking at graphs alone. So this page endeavours to run some simple statistics over your data to help you
spot trends and triggers so that you may eliminate and reduce your unwanted reactions and emotions to these events and activities.

data to find as much as it can, it can only analyse the data you enter, so enter a lot.
