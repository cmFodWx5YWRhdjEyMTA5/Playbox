<p>Tracking your emotions lies at the heart of CBT (Cognitive Behavioural Therapy. As part of treatment
	for all kinds of problems, including but not limited to; depression, anxiety, and
	chronic fatigue, it is a good idea to regularly track how you are feeling so when
	you look back on your week / month / year, you can properly see how you felt. Hopefully
	seeing that it was not as bad as you thought, and you are better over time. Personally, as I am
	suffering from Chronic Fatigue, I track:
	<ul>
	<li>Anxiety</li>
	<li>Depression</li>
	<li>Fatigue</li>
	</ul>
	Along with the built in:
	<ul>
	<li>Activity, I use a <img src="images/misfit-shine-pulsera.jpg" style="height: 24px"/><a href="http://misfit.com/products/shine">Misfit Shine</a> fitness tracker watch to track a number of "Points" each day.</li>
	<li>Sleep, the same <a href="http://misfit.com/products/shine">fitness tracker</a> I have records sleep and deep sleep amounts.</li>
	<li>Events, mostly external triggers of Anxiety, Stress, and thence Fatigue.</li>
	</ul>

and the activity you are managing. This is particularly useful and interesting if you are suffering, as I am, from Chronic Fatigue. Tracking sleep
is a tricky one, I use a 
<a href="http://misfit.com/products/shine">Misfit Shine</a> fitness tracker I got from 
<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Misfit-Personal-Physical-Activity-Monitor/dp/B00FDWN8RM/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1425212586&sr=8-1&keywords=misfit+shine">Amazon</a>.
There are lots of trackers available and more become available every week so I wont list or review them here. Just to say that I have found the Shine to
be useful as its simple watch battery lasts over a month, it tracks activity while I cycle, and seems effective at tracking my sleep patterns. If you don't want
to buy anything though, a simple step-tracker is only Â£10 or so, or just log the number of minutes you went walking for, and how long you were in bed. It is not the
numbers that are important, just how they vary and change, so your guesses can be widely wrong, as long as they are consistently and relatively wrong, the tracking still works.

<p><img src="images/graphs.png" style="height: 64px"/>When you have tracked some data, check out the graphs and the "Analysis" tab. It should show you how your negative emotions are coming down over time, and how
external events affect your mood. In the case of fatigue, it should be that a consistent level of activity helps, but too much or too little causes a blip in your fatigue.
Personally I found this to be true, however, the largest contributing factor to mine were external work stresses. Something that helped me speed my recovery significantly
by dealing with, and reducing, these external sources of Anxiety.
